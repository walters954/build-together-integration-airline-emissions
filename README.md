# Airline Emissions Tracking Integration - #4
### _[Salesforce Mentor - Build Together](https://courses.salesforcementor.com/p/build-together/)_

A month-long project you build on a team of 2-3 with other learning Salesforce developers. Small groups will work together to complete development assignments. A weekly meeting with experienced developers to go over questions and review code. Get hands-on experience by working on projects in a team with requirements.

## Overview & Learning Objectives
Create an application that creates/retrieves airline emission data stored in Salesforce using [Carbon Interface](https://docs.carboninterface.com/#/) API.
- Understanding of Salesforce integration
- Work with Salesforce APIs, including REST and SOAP
- Practical knowledge of Salesforce integration tools, such as Apex, LWC, and the Salesforce Connector
- Best practices for Salesforce integration, including error handling, testing, and deployment
- Integration with third-party applications, such as ERPs and marketing automation tools
- Real-world scenario-based learning
- Troubleshooting and debugging skills

## Project Requirements  
- Callout to Carbon Interface API
  - Create flight estimate emission
  - Pull all estimated  emissions
- Process API responses into a wrapper class and Salesforce objects
- Create automation on Salesforce object creation to create flight estimates via the API

## Getting Started
- Clone this repository onto your local computer and open the folder in Visual Studio Code
- Create a branch from the main branch for your team or individually
  - (ADVANCED) Create a subbranch for each week and merge that into the main team branch
- Connect to your playground org and start coding!

## Development Requirements
- Must use SFDX, git, GitHub, and Visual Studio Code, **NO DEVELOPER CONSOLE!**
- Your code should be able to run in any playground org via a GitHub repo
- Must be able to commit to meeting weekly with a large group
- Do not use configuration automation or middleware to do integration

## Notes
- Build Together is meant to be challenging. You will be asked to figure things out with your team. Sr. Dev will guide you but not fully outline what you should be doing. Asking questions is the more important thing.
- You can use other resources but don’t copy it word for word. You should be able to explain what your code is doing.
- Team members are meant to keep each other accountable, but if a team member is not pulling their weight, they will be cut.
